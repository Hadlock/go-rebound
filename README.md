** What

This is a little containerizable web application for exposing
diagnostic information about UpGuard appliances without requiring CS
engineers to go to the command line.

** TODO

	* Angularize the front end
	* Allow deeper dives into specific unit and container process details
	* Refactor for dependency injection, better testing
	* Add an authentication system 
	* Add the ability to make changes to a running appliance, eg
      restart a unit
